Variational autoencoder for lorenz attractor
In the recent era, deep learning models have gained significant popularity due to their ability to learn and replicate complex trends, making them suitable for addressing real-world problems. This project aims to bridge the gap between the non-linear dynamics of real-world phenomena and the capabilities of deep learning models. The Lorenz attractor, a hallmark of chaotic systems, serves as a challenging benchmark for modelling and predicting such nonlinear dynamics. This study employs a Variational Autoencoder-Recurrent Neural Network (VAE-RNN) to capture the underlying structure of the Lorenz attractor and predict its future states. This project demonstrates that by combining the representational power of VAEs with the temporal modelling capability of RNNs, it is possible to learn the dynamics of chaotic systems, enabling both accurate short-term predictions and meaningful latent space representations. This approach highlights the potential of deep learning in unravelling the complexities of non-linear systems and offers a promising direction for applying such models to real-world chaotic phenomena.
